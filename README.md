# 🗳️ Aether Vote

✨ **A Next-Gen Blockchain Voting System** ✨

Welcome to Aether Vote! This is a concept application demonstrating how blockchain technology can be visualized for secure, immutable voting systems. It's built with love, React, and a sprinkle of 3D magic.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Secure Ledger**: Visualizes a blockchain data structure where every vote is a transaction block.
*   **Aesthetic UI**: Brutalist typography meets soft interactive animations.
*   **3D Shaders**: A custom WebGL background that reacts to your mouse interactions.
*   **Instant Mining**: Simulates Proof-of-Work to "lock in" your vote.

## 🎨 Tech Stack

*   **React 18** + **TypeScript**
*   **Tailwind CSS** for styling
*   **Framer Motion** for silky smooth transitions
*   **Three.js / React-Three-Fiber** for the GLSL background

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Clone this repo!
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Start the magic: `npm start`

## 💖 Notes

The blockchain implementation is client-side for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this would connect to a real Ethereum or Solana smart contract!
